# Sinatra Simple

Other than a straight Sinatra install, and as it's name suggests, this is my most basic Sinatra template. 

It extends Sinatra::Base, so it can be used for prototyping standalone web applications or Rack middleware, and the template includes support for:

* Test frameworks
  * RSpec
  * Cucumber
* View templating with Haml
* Stylesheets based on SCSS with some of my personal mixins
* Dependencies managed with Bundler, so my Gemfile is included

As an RVM user and fan, I've included a .rvmrc file in the project to set up Ruby Enterprise Edition and a default gemset.

Feel free to fork this template for your own purposes, but it comes with the obligatory disclaimer, no guarantees or support.
